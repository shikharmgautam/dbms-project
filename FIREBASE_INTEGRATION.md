# Firebase Authentication Integration

## What Changed

### Authentication
- **Before**: Supabase Authentication
- **After**: Firebase Authentication

### Implementation Details

1. **Firebase Configuration** (`src/lib/firebase.ts`)
   - Initialized Firebase app with your project credentials
   - Exported Firebase Auth instance

2. **Auth Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Replaced Supabase auth methods with Firebase:
     - `signInWithEmailAndPassword` - User login
     - `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` - User signup
     - `firebaseSignOut` - User logout
     - `onAuthStateChanged` - Session monitoring
   - User IDs now come from Firebase (FirebaseUser.uid)

3. **Database Migration**
   - Removed foreign key constraint from `profiles.id` to `auth.users`
   - Profile IDs now store Firebase UIDs instead of Supabase user IDs

## What Stayed the Same

- **Supabase Database**: All data storage remains in Supabase PostgreSQL
- **User Profiles**: Still stored in Supabase `profiles` table
- **All other tables**: Students, companies, jobs, applications, etc. - all in Supabase
- **Row Level Security**: All RLS policies work the same way
- **Application Flow**: No changes to UI or user experience

## How It Works

1. User signs up/logs in through Firebase Authentication
2. Firebase returns a User object with a unique UID
3. We store the Firebase UID in Supabase `profiles` table
4. All subsequent database queries use the Firebase UID to fetch user data
5. Firebase handles authentication, Supabase handles everything else

## Testing

The application has been built successfully with Firebase integration. You can now:
- Sign up new users (creates Firebase auth + Supabase profile)
- Sign in existing users (Firebase auth, then loads Supabase profile)
- Sign out (Firebase sign out)

All features continue to work exactly as before.
